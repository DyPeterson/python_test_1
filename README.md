### Description

Python code that creates a database of songs & artists and compares certain aspects of them.

### Technologies Used:

- Python 3.7
- JupyterLabs

#### Programs used:
- Visual Code Studio
- WSL2 (ubuntu 20.04)
- Windows Terminal
 ### Setup & Installation:

1. Through the terminal like [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

	2. Open the terminal and navigate to where you would like the new project to be using `cd` commands. Its also recommended that you make a new directory using `mkdir *directory-name*`.

	3. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/DyPeterson/python_test_1.git`

	4. After cloning the directory it will appear in the directory that your terminal is set to. So make sure you are in the directory that you want this project copied to.
	6.  Once this project is cloned you can navigate to that folder within your terminal and create a virtual environment ' python3.7 -m venv |any-name|'. Now activate the venv with `source venv/bin/activate`
	7. Install jupyterlabs `pip install jupyterlab`
	8. `code .` to open in coding software or `python3.7 main.py` to run through the terminal.
3. Through github.com

4. Go to the project's directory page **[HERE](https://github.com/DyPeterson/python_test_1.git)**

5. Click the green `code` button to open the drop-down menu.

6. At the bottom of the menu will have *Download Zip*. Go ahead and click it to download the project.

7. Once downloaded find the `.zip` file and right-click it to bring up the menu. Within that menu click `Extract Here` to extract it in the current folder or click `Extract Files...`to select which folder you would like the project in.

8. Once the project has been extracted, locate the folder in a terminal and open it with `code .` or alternatively `python3.7 main.py` to run through the terminal.

### Details

This project was made for a independent code review at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/). It's intention is to show what I have learned in the past week and to demonstrate it to an instructor. This week we were asked to use Python and to meet the following objectives

1. Create classes for artists and songs, giving them unique attributes.

2. Create 2 validation functions that check to see if an artist exists in our database and have the other function check if a song is by a certain artist.

3. Make a database of Songs and Artists

4. Give the Songs and Artists unique IDs

Thank you for checking out my project. If you would like to contact me, you can do so by emailing me at <dylan.peterson17@gmail.com>
